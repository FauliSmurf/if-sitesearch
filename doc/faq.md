    to provide search functionality for their websites.

* What is the difference between **sites** and **pages**?
    * A **site** is a *website* that can contain thousands of **pages**. 
    You may have two **sites**: *en.example.com* and *de.example.com* 
    and each may contain thousands of pages in the respective language.

* What is a **tenant**?
    * A tenant is an organizational entity** that can manage **dozens of independent sites**.

* Do I need the **search bar** to use Site Search?
    * No, not necessarily; our **search bar is a sample implementation** to quickly show you how 
    a search bar may look like and interact with our *Site Search service*.
    Still, our **search bar** is a production-grade implementation and ready for production deployments.

* Can I use my own search bar with Site Search?

* How can I make my website searchable?
    * The easiest & quickest way is to use the [Site Search Gadget](https://sitesearch.cloud/sitesearch-gadget.html)
    to **create an index** from an RSS / Atom feed and make it **instantly searchable** without even embedding it into a website.
    If your website does not expose any feeds, you need to use our open [API](https://sitesearch.cloud/swagger-ui.html#!/page45controller/indexNewSiteUsingPOST)
    to **index your website page by page** calling the API.
    
* Where can I find an API documentation and specification for Site Search?

* What does Site Search cost?

    and additional **enterprise offerings**.
